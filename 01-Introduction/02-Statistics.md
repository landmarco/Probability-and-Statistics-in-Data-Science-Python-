# Statistics 

  - Probability theory computes probabilities of complex events given the underlying base probabilities.
  - Statistics takes us in the opposite direction.
  - We are given data that was generated by a Stochastic process.
  - We infer properties of the underlying base probabilities.

### Deciding whether a coin is biased

  - We discussed the distribution of the number of heads when flipping a fair coin many times.
  - Turning the question around: we flip a coin 1000 times and get 570 heads.
  - Can we conclude that the coin is biased (not fair) ?
  - What can we conclude if we got 507 heads?
  
##### Solving the problem

  - Suppose that the coin is fair.
  - Use probability theory to compute the probability of getting at least 570 (or 507) heads.
  - If this probability is very small, then we can reject with confidence the hypothesis that the coin is fair.
  - We used ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20&plus;-%201)
  - Sum ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bk%7D) = ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bk%7D%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bk%7Dx_%7Bi%7D), k = 1000
  - If number of heads is 570570 then ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7B1000%7D)=570âˆ’430=140
  - ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7CS_%7B1000%7D%7C) > ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?4%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D) ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Capprox%20126.5)
  - It is very unlikely that the coin is unbiased.
  - Meanwhile 507 heads = 493 tails, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S_%7Bn%7D%20%3D%2014%3C%20126.5)
  - We cannot conclude that coin is biased.
 
 ### Real World Examples
 
 ##### Pools
  - Suppose elections will take place in a few days and we want to know how people plan to vote.
    Suppose there are just two parties: D and R.

  - We could try and ask all potential voters.
  - That would be very expensive.
  - Instead, we can use a poll: call up a small randomly selected set of people.
  - Call n people at random and count the number of D
  - Can you say with confidence that there are more D votes, or more R votes?
  - Mathematically equivalent to flipping a biased coin
 
 ##### A/B Testing
  - A common practice when optimizing a web page is to perform A/B tests.
  - A/B refer to two alternative designs for the page
  - To see which design users prefer we randomly present design A or design B.
  - We measure how long the user stayed on a page, or whether the user clicked on an advertisement.
  - We want to decide, with confidence, which of the two designs is better.
  - Again: similar to making a decision with confidence on whether "Heads" is more probably than "Tails" or vice versa.
